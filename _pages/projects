  **Course projects** -
  
  **Machine Learning(Prof.Arun, IITM)**
     
    * Implemented and analysed many ML algorithms:

    * Data contest for predicting movie rating:  Task was to predict movie rating, given dataset we had to try different collaborative filtering like- Nearest Neihjbour model. Got best with  Modified latent factor model. With 73% accuracy, we achieved 11th rank on Kaggle.


     **Deep learning(Prof. Mithesh Khapra, IITM)**

    * Compressed Representation of Data using Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM):  Trained RBM using Contrastive Divergence (CD) algorithm to learn an n-dimensional hidden representation of 784-dimensional binary Fashion MNIST image dataset. 

    * Text Transliteration using LSTM based Encoder-Decoder: Performed English to Hindi Transliteration by training a bidirectional LSTM Encoder and 2-layered Decoder with attention mechanism with 52% accuracy.

    * Image Classification using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):  Built a CNN using TensorFlow and trained it on a subset of ImageNet dataset for the classification of the images.

    **Reinforcement Learning(Prof. Balaraman Ravindran, IITM)**

   * Bandits: Implemented and did the comparative analysis for the following bandit algorithms- Epsilon-greedy, soft-max, UCB1, Median.

   * RL algorithms comparative analysis:  Implemented SARSA, Q-Learning, Sarsa Lambda which learns Q-values over states. and implemented policy gradient which directly learns policy over states and did the comparative analysis.

   * Four rooms and the cart-pole:  Implemented SMDP-Q learning and Intra-option learning on  Four room environment and found that Intra-option learning is sample efficient. Tried DQN for cart pole and successfully completed the task of an average 195 reward over 100 episodes in less than 200 episodes.
