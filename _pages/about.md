I am currently working in Oracle Financial Services Software as an Application Developer.

I completed my Masters By Research from IIT Madras in Computer Science and engineering under the supervision of Prof. Balaraman Ravindran.

My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning and deep learning, as well as applying the concepts to solve real world problems in Finance, Healthcare, Automation and Human Capital Management.

I hold Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology.
