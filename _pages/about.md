 I’m a graduate student at IIT Madras pursuing MS by research in Computer Science. I am working with Prof. Balaraman Ravindran 

My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning and deep learning, as well as applying the concepts to solve real world problems in Finance, Healthcare, Automation and Human Capital Management.

I hold Bachelor’s Degree in Computer Science & Engineering from Madan Mohan Malaviya University of Technology.
