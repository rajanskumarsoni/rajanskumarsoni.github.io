**Thesis work**: HMMs are extensively used in many areas in machine learning, but we have only predefined metric to compare two HMMs. I proposed a supervised metric, where I used the graph neural network to come up with an algorithm which uses graphical characteristics of Hmms being compared. On FSDD dataset all
existing algorithm reaches at max 35% accuracy(predefined) whereas our metric gives 85% accuracy.
